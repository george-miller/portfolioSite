	    		<a href='http://www.georgemyersmiller.com/' target="_blank"><h4>Personal Server</h4></a>
	    		<p>This Django website aggregates all of my projects that are on my personal server.  This project contains a simple polls app that I used to learn Django, an API that I created for my app Icarus on the Google Play Store, and a wrapper for my Java Applet Game Phoenix. This project also has links to get to all my other projects on my server.</p>

	    		<p>As I taught myself more about software engineering, I found it hard to accurately portray the new skills I have learned about thoughful design and clear, concise code.  To highlight these skills, I am writing a Java Applet Game, mirroring an old TI-83 Calculator game.  I will be writing a document alongside the code entailing every decision I make, every option I consider, everything that comes into my head as I am designing and writing this game will be documented.  This means that you can see exactly how I think, and how I approach software and design problems.</p>
	    		<a href='http://www.georgemyersmiller.com/is/' target="_blank"><h4>Intellectual Sharing</h4></a>
	    		<p>This Django and Neo4j project attempts to encapsulate knowledge of everything in the world through the idea that everything has (1) a defenition and (2) relationships to other things.  I am working on this project with two other people.</p>

		    <h3>Clean Code</h3>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing code has always been an enjoyable process, from the first program I wrote.  Turning ideas into executable code and actually seeing that code work gives me a feeling of accomplishment and pride.  However, it wasn't until I read the books <i>Pragmatic Programming</i>, <i>Clean Code</i>, and <i>The Clean Coder</i> that I realized how little I knew about the professional aspect of code.  When I look back at the code I wrote as a beginner, I am astounded at how disorganized it was.  Sure, I was able to get it to work, but as I read it now, I cannot even dissern what each function is supposed to do.  Practices like meaningful naming, test driven development, and merciless refactoring have helped my code projects become readable, coherent pieces of professional software.  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I finished a good refactoring session was an awesome feeling.  Simply looking at the code I had written put a smile on my face; it was logical.  The rationality of it was inevitable.  The benefits of good planning and well thought out structure were enormous.  I felt in control and I wasn't afraid to make a change here or try some new stuff over there.  This is the feeling I strive for in any project I work on.  After all of these experiences, I have learned that making the code clean is just as important as making the code work. If code that works isn't clean, it works as a result of coinsidence, not planning, and thus become a mess. The develpoer is afraid to touch the mess, because he really doesn't know how it works.  How can we expect code to work if we don't know how it works ourselves?  The answer is keep our disciplines at hand, and never tolerate a mess. </p>
			<h3>Logical Systems</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Code is a tool used to create systems and define their functionality.  When creating any system, it is crucial to seperate the system's functionality into distinguishable parts and organize that functionality in a logical way.  For example, the logical way a flashlight should be arranged is with the power button on the side and the circuitry inside.  If I were making a flashlight, I wouldn't put the power button on the top because that is where the light goes.  I also wouldn't put the circuitry that allows the flashlight to glow in a seperate container, where wires are connecting the flashlight to the container.  I would put the circuitry into the flashlight, and I would put the power button on the side, so people can use it comfortably.  Organizing the flashlight in this way also makes it easy for anyone to pick it up and use it with ease because it is arranged like one would expect.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This same idea applies to systems created by programmers.  If they are not arranged in a logical way, they will be harder to understand.  When reading your code, colleages would have to dive deep into the implementation of the code, creating confusion and misunderstanding of the intent of your program.  If code is arranged in a logical way, it is immensly easier to understand.  If you have one class doing all the work for what really should be a set of objects, the inner workings of that class are going to become conveluted.  The reader would have to go through the entire 2,000 line long class to figure out why it is not working as expected.  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have seperated your functionality into discrete and well-defined groups (aka modules) where code is organized based on subproblems, the reader can look at your class defenitions and get a big picture sense of what is going on and how it is being done.  Then if they need to get into the implementation details, they always know what is being done and why it is being done.  When extending a system of code such as the one I just described, a big picture understanding of the codebase is essential.  It allows you to see how your piece of code interacts with other pieces of code in the system and how your functionality gets used.  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without this understanding, bugs become huge roadblocks in your program because the programmer doesn't know what they mean or how to fix them. The only way to make sure the system you are creating is logical is to really take the time to understand the problem you are faced with, then plan a concrete and consistent outline for your system.  After that you make tests to test the overall functionality and integration of the system, then you would make unit tests to test individual pieces of functionality.  Once the unit tests pass, make the integration tests pass.  At the end of it you will be left with an understandable, reuseable system. </p>
			<!--h3>Tests</h3>
			<p>I love writing code.  Far better than the societal implications of my program is the personal satisfaction of building something.  Imagine you're a biochemist who has access to an infinitely large bank of chemicals and organisms, of all structures, molecular formulas, and species.   For safety, let's assume you have an impenetrable suit, so you will never get hurt if you make a dangerous substance or explosion.  It would be a playground: you create reactions from vinegar and baking soda to hydrogen fusion.  You would be able to observe whole communities of bacteria, exposing them to different stimuli/substances and seeing how they could react.  You would be able to conquer genetics, mixing species and overriding DNA sequences to cure cancer or aging.  Complete freedom in the laboratory like this would teach you an extreme amount about the world, and it would be a hell of a time. 
	This is exactly the feeling I get when writing code.  Programming is one of the few professions where you solve problems in a completely free environment.  You can tell the computer anything, and it will do it without hesitation.  You want to </p -->

		      <ul>
		    	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a senior at NYU studying Computer Science with a minor in Web Development.  I grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut and went to high school there.  Ever since I was a little boy I was always fasinated by electronics and the things they could do seemingly like magic.  Of course it all started with a deep love for video games, and all the time I spent with my brothers in my basement playing as a child gave me a deep passion for creating fun yet challenging games.  Even when it got too much and my parents had to smash our computers/consoles, I remember looking through the rubble to try and figure out how these pieces of metal did such amazing things.  I was so fascinated that at the age of 15, I worked long hours for my dad doing construction until I made enough money to buy the parts off of newegg and build my own computer.  This is the computer I still use today, after a few upgrades.</li>
		    	
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student who has almost completed his college experience, I can say that I now have a better view of how these complex pieces of circuitry work, and it feels amazing.  It is amazing to know that I can manipulate and create beautiful pieces of software that can have such great effects on the world around me (through games or anything else!).  However, Computer Science isn't a field where you can know everything, so I keep moving along, finding problems and solutions on a daily basis to help me understand the beautiful big picture, but also the ugly details.  Because of these events and ideas, creating and programming games is my number one passion, but in a lot of instances, I see that programming a more complex system that does actual good in the community can feel even better than creating a game.  I will never stop creating and brainstroming games, but I will also never stop tackling the hardest problem that comes my way, because in the end, the more complex problem I solve, the better I feel about myself and my creation.  </li>
