		    <h3>Clean Code</h3>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing code has always been an enjoyable process, from the first program I wrote to the kata I practice on a daily basis.  Turning ideas into executable code and actually seeing that code work gives me a feeling of accomplishment and pride.  However, it wasn't until I read the books <i>Pragmatic Programming</i>, <i>Clean Code</i>, and <i>The Clean Coder</i> that I realized how little I knew about the professional aspect of code.  When I look back at the code I wrote as a beginner, I am astounded at how disorganized my structure was.  Sure, I was able to get it to work, but as I read it now, I cannot even dissern what each function is supposed to do.  Practices like meaningful naming, test driven development, and merciless refactoring have transformed my code into readable, coherent pieces of professional software.  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I finished a good refactoring session was an awesome feeling.  Simply looking at the code I had written put a smile on my face; it was logical.  The rationality of it was inevitable.  The benefits of good planning and well thought out structure were enormous.  I felt in control, I wasn't afraid to make a change here or try some new stuff over there.  This is the feeling I strive for in any project I work on.  After all of these experiences, I have learned that making the code clean is just as important as making the code work. If code that works isn't clean, it works as a result of coinsidence, not planning, and thus become a mess. The develpoer is afraid to touch the mess, because he really doesn't know how it works.  How can we expect code to work if we don't know how it works ourselves?  The answer is keep our disciplines at hand, and never tolerate a mess. </p>

		    	<ul>
		    	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a rising Senior at NYU studying Computer Science with a minor in Web Development.  I grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut and went to high school there.  Ever since I was a little boy I was always fasinated by electronics and the things they could do seemingly like magic.  Of course it all started with a deep love for video games, and all the time I spent with my brothers in my basement playing as a child gave me a deep passion for creating fun yet challenging games.  Even when it got too much and my parents had to smash our computers/consoles, I remember looking through the rubble to try and figure out how these pieces of metal did such amazing things.  I was so fascinated that at the age of 15, I worked long hours for my dad doing construction until I made enough money to buy the parts off of newegg and build my own computer.  This is the computer I still use today, after a few upgrades.</li>
		    	<br/>
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student who has almost completed his college experience, I can say that I now have a better view of how these complex pieces of circuitry work, and it feels amazing.  It is amazing to know that I can manipulate and create beautiful pieces of software that can have such great effects on the world around me (through games or anything else!).  However, Computer Science isn't a field where you can know everything, so I keep moving along, finding problems and solutions on a daily basis to help me understand the beautiful big picture, but also the ugly details.  Because of these events and ideas, creating and programming games is my number one passion, but in a lot of instances, I see that programming a more complex system that does actual good in the community can feel even better than creating a game.  I will never stop creating and brainstroming games, but I will also never stop tackling the hardest problem that comes my way, because in the end, the more complex problem I solve, the better I feel about myself and my creation.  </li>
